A client has just performed {exercise} for {rep_count} reps.

Movement analysis showed:
{form_issues_str}

Mobility limitations detected: {mobility_flags_str}

The client is at an {experience_level} training level.

Based on the above, provide a short, technical, and supportive response with:
1. A clinical explanation of possible causes
2. 3 specific mobility/activation drills
3. 2 precise coaching cues
4. A short motivational closing statement

Use the calm, analytical tone of a physical therapist. Avoid hypeâ€”focus on joint function, movement correction, and long-term progress.
